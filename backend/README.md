## Frontend (Tailwind CSS)

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To compile the CSS:

1.  **Install Tailwind CSS**: Make sure you have Tailwind CSS installed globally. Then, in the `backend` directory, run:
2.  **Build Tailwind CSS**: To compile `input.css` into `output.css`:

    ```

    For development with live reloading:
    ```bash
    tailwindcss -i ./app/static/css/input.css -o ./app/static/css/output.css --watch
    ```
